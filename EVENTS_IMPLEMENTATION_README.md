- **Publishing options** (now, schedule, draft)
- **Authentication required** with proper checks
- **Success/error feedback** with form reset

### 5. API Endpoints

#### `GET /api/events`
- Fetch events with filtering and pagination
- Supports search, category, location, date, and price filters
- Returns transformed event data with computed fields

#### `POST /api/events`
- Create new events with validation
- Requires authentication
- Validates all required fields and data types
- Returns created event with creator information

#### `GET /api/events/[id]`
- Fetch single event by ID
- Includes creator details and attendee information
- Returns 404 for non-existent events

#### `PUT /api/events/[id]`
- Update event (creator only)
- Validates ownership and data integrity
- Returns updated event data

#### `DELETE /api/events/[id]`
- Delete event (creator only)
- Validates ownership before deletion

#### `POST /api/events/[id]/rsvp`
- RSVP to events (attending, interested, not_going)
- Requires authentication
- Validates event capacity
- Updates attendee counts automatically

#### `DELETE /api/events/[id]/rsvp`
- Remove RSVP from event
- Requires authentication
