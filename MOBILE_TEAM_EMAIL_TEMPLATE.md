**Subject:** âœ… Unified Event Categories - Backend Ready for Integration

---

**Hi Mobile Team,**

Thank you for the excellent feedback on the event categories system! You were absolutely right - we needed realistic event types, not music genres.

## âœ… **We've Implemented Everything**

We've completed the backend implementation for the unified event categories using **Option 1 (Separate Fields)** as you recommended:

- âœ… **15 unified event categories** (concerts_live_music, religious_spiritual, etc.)
- âœ… **14 music genres** (gospel, afrobeat, jazz, etc.) - optional field
- âœ… **Complete database migration script** with automatic mapping
- âœ… **New API endpoint** `/api/event-categories` to fetch categories
- âœ… **Updated push notification matching** to use new categories
- âœ… **TypeScript types** for both teams

## ðŸ“‹ **Documents for You**

All documentation is in the repo and ready for review:

1. **`MOBILE_TEAM_UNIFIED_CATEGORIES_RESPONSE.md`**
   - Complete integration guide
   - API endpoints with examples
   - Step-by-step mobile implementation guide
   - Testing instructions

2. **`database/unified_event_categories_migration.sql`**
   - Database migration script (we'll deploy this)

3. **`types/unified-event-categories.ts`**
   - TypeScript definitions you can use

4. **`apps/web/app/api/event-categories/route.ts`**
   - New API endpoint for fetching categories

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

**For Web Team (Us):**
1. Deploy database migration to Supabase (tomorrow, Oct 17)
2. Deploy updated API to Vercel (tomorrow, Oct 17)

**For Mobile Team (You):**
1. Review the integration guide
2. Update your app to use new categories
3. Test with our staging environment

**Together:**
- Joint testing on Oct 18
- Production deployment on Oct 18

## ðŸ“ž **Let's Sync**
