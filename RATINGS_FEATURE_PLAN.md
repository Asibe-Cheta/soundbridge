title: Ratings Feature Plan
status: Draft
owner: Mobile Team
audience: Web App Team + Mobile Team
---

# Goals
- Allow users to rate creators and service providers post-engagement.
- Store ratings and compute aggregates (average + count).

# Agreed Decisions
- Ratings allowed only after completed paid interactions (event ticket, paid service, paid collaboration).
- One rating per rater per rated user per context; updates overwrite prior rating for that context.
- Comments allowed with flagging + admin review queue.

# Backend Requirements

## Tables
```sql
create table if not exists creator_ratings (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  rated_user_id uuid not null,
  rater_user_id uuid not null,
  rating int not null check (rating between 1 and 5),
  comment text,
  context text, -- event | service | collaboration | general
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create index if not exists idx_creator_ratings_user on creator_ratings(rated_user_id);
```

## Aggregation
Option A: Trigger updates on `profiles`:
- `profiles.rating_avg`
- `profiles.rating_count`

Option B: Periodic cron to compute aggregates.

# Questions for Web Team
1) Who can rate: only after paid interactions or any connection?  
Answer: Only after completed paid interaction (event ticket, paid service, or paid collaboration).
2) Do we allow multiple ratings per rater or only latest?  
Answer: One rating per rater per rated user per context (event/service/collab); updates overwrite.
3) Should we moderate comments?  
Answer: Yes. Allow comments with flagging + admin review queue.
