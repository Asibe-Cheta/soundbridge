# ðŸš¨ DEPLOYMENT STATUS TEST

## URGENT: Test if our latest deployment is actually live

**Expected Debug Logs Missing:**
- `ðŸš¨ STRIPE CHECKOUT API: Request received at [timestamp]`
- `ðŸš¨ STRIPE CHECKOUT API: Starting processing...`
- `ðŸš¨ CHECKOUT AUTH: Getting user with Bearer token...`

**This suggests our latest deployment with timeout fixes is NOT live yet.**

## IMMEDIATE TEST NEEDED:

1. **Test deployment endpoint again:**
   ```
   GET https://soundbridge.live/api/test-deployment
   ```
   
2. **Check for new version:**
   - Should show `"deployment_version": "v2024-09-28-stripe-checkout-timeout-fix"`
   - If still shows old version, deployment failed

3. **Check Vercel dashboard:**
   - Look for deployment status
   - Check for any deployment errors
   - Verify latest commit is deployed

## POSSIBLE ISSUES:

1. **Vercel deployment failed** - build errors, timeout
2. **Function caching** - old version still running  
3. **Route conflicts** - middleware blocking requests
4. **Environment issues** - missing variables causing startup failure

## NEXT STEPS:

If deployment test still shows old version:
- Force redeploy on Vercel
- Clear function cache
- Check build logs for errors
