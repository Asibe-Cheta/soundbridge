## ⚠️ **WHY EVENTBRITE REDIRECT FAILS**

1. **£0 ticket revenue** - Miss entire revenue stream
2. **User exodus** - They leave for Eventbrite, never return
3. **No data** - Can't build insights, personalization
4. **Eventbrite wins** - They promote competing events
5. **Low valuation** - "Lead generation site" not "platform"
6. **No moat** - Easy to replicate
7. **Training competitors** - You drive traffic to Eventbrite

---

## 🏆 **UNIQUE SOUNDBRIDGE ADVANTAGES**

**What you can do that Eventbrite can't:**

1. **Music → Events**: Fans of artist X see their events automatically
2. **Community Discovery**: Friends attending, social proof
3. **Bundling**: Album + ticket packages
4. **Data Insights**: "90% of attendees listen to gospel"
5. **Platform Lock-In**: Music + Events + Networking = sticky

**Your moat:** Only platform combining music discovery + event ticketing for faith & cultural music
