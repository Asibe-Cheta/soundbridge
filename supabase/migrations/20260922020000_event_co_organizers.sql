-- Item 43: Co-Organizer Tagging for Events
--
-- A junction table letting an event's creator tag other registered SoundBridge
-- users as co-organisers. Multiple co-organisers per event, no cap. Tagging is
-- restricted to the event's creator (not self-service by the tagged user) —
-- matches "type @ to search and add" in the creation form, not an invite/accept
-- flow. Permissions scope deliberately stops here: this table only records who
-- is tagged, it does not grant edit access to the event — that's explicitly out
-- of scope per COORGANIZER_TAG.MD ("do not build any new permissions system").
--
-- Same table mobile ships against (see soundbridge-mobile-app's copy of this
-- migration) — mirrored here so it's tracked in web's own migration history
-- instead of only existing in the mobile repo.
